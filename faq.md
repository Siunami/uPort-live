# Frequently Asked Questions

**WIP: This is where we can pre-emptively answer questions about uPort-live, and will likely end up on the site somewhere**

## What is uPort?

uPort is a blockchain-based, decentralized identity platform that gives back users control of their data.  Learn more at [uport.me](https://uport.me)

## What is an attendance credential? 

An attendance credential is a cryptographically signed message that is given by the organizer of an event that can be used to verify their attendance at some later time.  Think of it as an electronic version of your receipt, with the added bonuses of being unforgeable and harder to lose!

## What can I do with my attendance credentials?

For starters, the credential allows you to prove to anyone anywhere at any time that you went to a specific event, and its validity is independent of the uPort Live webapp.  The uPort Live team is also developing more ways to interact with your credentials, and future events may offer discounts for repeat attendees, or employers may be interested in conferences you have attended.  In short, the possibilities are endless, stay tuned!

## Does uPort Live keep track of the events that I've attended?

Absolutely not!  The best part of a decentralized identity platform is that you are the only one who holds onto the data that you generate.  The cryptographic properties of the blockchain allow anyone you share that data with to verify its validity without having to rely on us (or anyone else) as a trusted third party.
