# Frequently asked questions

## Platform

### What is uPort?
uPort returns ownership of identity to the individual. uPort's open identity system allows users to register their own identity on Ethereum, send and request credentials, sign transactions, and securely manage keys & data. Learn more at uport.me

### What is an attendance credential?
An attendance credential is a cryptographically signed message that is given by the organizer of an event that can be used to verify a user’s attendance at any later time. Think of it as an electronic version of your receipt, with the added bonuses of being unforgeable and harder to lose!

### I'm a blockchain enthusiast, how does it really work?
It does! This is just one example of uPort’s mission, where we believe that everyone has the right to control their own digital identity - how it’s shaped, shared and sustained.
uPort Live might look simple, but it is created on a secure architecture which is building a shared identity web of trust. Your app will store a set of credentials you have collected from the network, where no one can access them but yourself. This will allow you to take control of your identity and be able to grow your reputation across this new web of trust. If interested in the building blocks, please see our open source repositories on [Github](https://github.com/Siunami/uPort-live)

### Will I be able to see how many attendees get my event credentials?
Yes, when you go to your dashboard and click on the event you created, you will be able to see a counter that adds the number of attendees that have received your event credential.

### I’m GDPR compliant, do I need to worry about user’s personal information?
You don’t have to worry at all, the user information is only kept in their own device. Blockchain and uPort allowed us to develop the whole process in a decentralized manner, so no personal information is kept be either uPort Live or the organizer. This way the information is shared and verified, but never stored.


## Users
         	
### How do I receive an attendance credential?
It’s very easy. First, you need to download the uPort app and create your new digital identity (link). Second, go to the event booth where the organizer is giving the credentials and simply open your uPort app, scan the QR code provided by the organizer and accept the push notification in your phone.

### What can I do with my attendance credentials?
For starters, the credential allows you to prove to anyone anywhere at any time that you went to a specific event, and its validity is independent of the uPort Live webapp. The uPort Live team is also developing more ways to interact with your credentials, and future events may offer discounts for repeat attendees, or employers may be interested in conferences you have attended. In short, the possibilities are endless, stay tuned!

### Does uPort Live keep track of the events that I've attended?
Absolutely not! The best part of a decentralized identity platform is that you are the only one who holds onto the data that you generate. The cryptographic properties of the blockchain allow anyone you share that data with to verify its validity without having to rely on us (or anyone else) as a trusted third party.
