# About

### uPort Live is creating a credential ecosystem that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and the uPort platform to reward event attendees with attestations that verify their participation in such event.

### By scanning a QR code in the registration desk, an event attendee with receive a personalized attendance credential on her/his uPort ID. Organizers will have previously created that unique credential through our easy to use uPort Live webapp.

### Down the line, we aim to take advantage of the traction created, and update our event credential software to be used in other environments such as educational platforms, employer/employee attestation and even fun, web based, interaction exercises with uPort.

### Additionally, we will explore further in-app features so keep in touch with our releases on our uPort channels found below.
