# uPort Live

uPort Live is a web application for issuing attestations (aka badges, credentials) for event attendance using the uPort app.  We hope that this will serve as a convenient way to integrate uPort into large events in the ethereum space and generate excitement around the product, while developing a major application of decentralized identity.  As this project grows, it may expand into any number of microcredentialling directions, from educational credentials to crypto-sticker collection.

## Architecture

The application itself will issue two types of attestation: one to event owners, containing all of the information necessary to define the event, and asserting that they are an organizer.  Owners of an event organization credential then have the ability to issue attendance credentials to other users by generating a QR within the app.
